Various addons and scripts for Blender 3D

=========================================


io_import_mc

*WIP*
Addon to import Maya Cache files (.xml + .mc) files.
Only geometry caches are supported (ChannelInterpretation="positions").
It tries to match the channel names with the objects in the scene. If e.g. the
channel name is "my_nice_meshShape" then it looks if the object "my_nice_mesh"
exists.

Todo:
* Add support for cachetype 'OneFilePerFrame'.
* Make the settings in the import file browser work (they are ignored at the
  moment).
* Use the 'self.report' for proper error and info messages.
* ...
* Integrate in a bigger import/export pipeline.
* Eventually add .mc support to the 'Mesh Cache' modifier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add_curve_wires

Creates (hanging) wires between two objects. You can create them between the
selected faces and have them connect faces with the same material.

Todo:
* Cleanup.
* Maybe improve/add stuff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

io_export_objFolder

Export (the selected) objects as .obj's to a chosen directory.

Todo:
* Integrate in a bigger import/export pipeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

io_import_caches

Import geometry caches (only .pc2 and .mdd at the moment). It tries to match
the name from a cache file with an object (e.g. 'my_mesh.pc2' > 'my_mesh').
If you select/choose one or more cache files, only these will be imported. If
you don't select any files, all cache files in the directory will be imported.
You can choose if you want to import them as shapekeys or use the 'Mesh Cache'
modifier (default and recommended).

Todo:
* Settings (for re-timing) of the cache(s)
    - modifier: set all settings for the modifier in the import file browser.
    - shapekeys: specify frame offset, scale and interpolation
* Only import cache(s) for the selected object(s) (for convenience).
* Integrate in a bigger import/export pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

io_import_objects

Import all or only the selected .obj files. If you select one or more .obj
files, only these will be imported. If you don't select/choose any file,
all files in the directory will be imported.

Todo:
* Allow user to set the settings for the importer.
* Support more file formats.
* Integrate in a bigger import/export pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

io_import_pc2

Import .pc2 pointcache file as shapekeys. You have to select a mesh object for
which to import the pointcache.

Todo:
* Add more options (scale and interpolation).
* Integrate in a bigger import/export pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jasperge_tools

Several simple tools to use:
* Incremental save like Maya has (for convenience in mixed software projects).
* Copy modifier settings from the active object to the selected object(s).
* Turn off/on the modifiers in the viewport (except: 'ARMATURE', 'CURVE' and
  'SIMPLE DEFORM') for all objects.
* Turn on/off wireframes for all objects.

Todo:
* Allow a limit for the number of incremental save files.
* Turn off/on modifiers and wireframes only for selected objects.
* Add more tools if I need them...
